      <p class="paragraph"><span class="title">Hey, I'm Brandy! </span><br></br> <br></br>I'm a really energetic & bubbly person who can make anyone feel right at home. I've had a passion for software development & technology for as far back as I can remember! <br></br> As a child, I always liked tinkering with technology ðŸ’¾, & throughout my childhood would take things apart to put them back together to see how certain things *clicked* & worked as a whole. <br></br>In High School I was on a team of six for Vex Robotics ( 6135C ðŸ¤– ) & placed 20th in the world in 2016. From there I dove deeper & deeper into the programming web - first picking up HTML, CSS, Lua & C. I attended an online coding bootcamp ( thanks Lambda! ) & spent over 2000hrs+ of time coding & where I further developed my skills in HTML & CSS, & picked up several other languages & frameworks, and can now say I'm more than comfortable with developing any Full Stack Web Application thrown my way! I also led groups as little as seven and as large as fourteen through daily 1:1's, weekly sprint's, and code challenges as a Team Lead for Lambda! Check out some of my work below, & if you have any questions, please reach out & contact me! Thanks!</p>
